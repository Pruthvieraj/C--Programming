C-Programming
A collection of C programming exercises and projects. Covers everything from variables to data structures. Featuring algorithms, problem-solving exercises, and best coding practices. This repository is a collection of C programming exercises, concepts, and mini-projects that I am working on as I improve my coding skills. It serves as a structured reference for fundamental and advanced topics in C.

📌 Topics Covered
✔️ Basics (Syntax, Data Types, Loops, Conditionals)
✔️ Functions & Recursion
✔️ Pointers & Memory Management
✔️ File Handling
✔️ Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues)
✔️ Mini Projects & Algorithms
